# Pay Transparency Card ðŸ’¶ ðŸ”Ž ðŸ”–

## Preempt the recruiters: Settle the facts on role, compensation, and everything else you want from a job.

One of the big pains of being in the market is that you get unwarranted recruitment offers (wrong job; wrong salary range; wrong anything) or you might want to look for something new but don't want to go all green-marked "#opentowork" on LinkedIn.

_More and more of the tech world is going all-in on pay transparency (it's even becoming law in the EU)â€”why not do it yourself, too?_

The **Pay Transparency Card** is a simple Markdown-based "card", or set of facts, that you want to convey when actively (or passively!) job-hunting. It helps you communicate what type of role you're after and what compensation expectations you have, _before_ anyone contacts you! Or you just want to feel more confident when you get a call, since you've thought out all the facts already. Or you just want to ward off folks with the entirely wrong idea of what you might want to do.

You do you!

## How to use it?

Simple! Use it any way you like. Some suggestions:

- Copy the template into a new Markdown file, update the demo facts, and put it in a public Gist that you link to when recruiters get in touch.
- Copy the template and adapt it to your website or other interactive context so it's easily viewable.
- Copy the template and make it part of your CV.
- Make a nice widget that renders the information on your GitHub page, website, or wherever!
