## General guidelines for contributing to the project

The Pay Transparency Card is an initiative for the software engineering community. It aims to respect the wide variety of people working in it, and to support it with something that has sometimes been a pain: Bad recruiting, misleading ads and job descriptions, and salary pinball. Transparency will help that situation.

When contributing to this project, please take the above to heart. If your contribution helps support that vision, feel free to make a pull request and I will consider merging it.
